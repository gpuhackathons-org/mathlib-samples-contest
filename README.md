# Math Libraries Sample Contest

This repository will host submissions for contests to extend the set of samples that are provided with the [CUDA Math Libraries](https://github.com/NVIDIA/CUDALibrarySamples) created by the developer community. 

Contestants will be asked to provide a sample application that illustrates some aspects of using the Math Libraries.
